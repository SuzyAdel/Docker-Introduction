# Docker-Introduction
| Step       | Purpose                                          | Builds on                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Task 1** | Create and run a static web app in Docker        | Base app running                      |
| **Task 2** | Add Keycloak with Docker Compose and link to app | App now has login system via Keycloak |



## TASK 1

Objective:

- Deploy a lightweight static web application inside a Docker container to understand image creation, container management, and application isolation.

1. Installed Docker and verified it works.

2. Cloned the GitHub repo (getting-started).

3. Created your own small app folder (my-app) with index.html and a Dockerfile.

4. Built your Docker image (suzy-docker-app).

5. Ran it inside a container (suzy-running-app) and confirmed it in your browser (http://localhost:8080).

Concepts Learned:

- üß± Docker Image: A blueprint containing app code, dependencies, and runtime environment.

- üì¶ Container: A running instance of the image ‚Äî isolated yet lightweight.

- üõ†Ô∏è Dockerfile: Defines build instructions (base image, copy files, expose ports).

- üåç Port Mapping: Allows external access to a containerized app.
   
## TASK 2 
Objective 
- Install and configure a local Keycloak instance (Identity and Access Management system) using Docker Compose.

1. Create a docker-compose.yml defining both Keycloak and PostgreSQL services.

2. Configure environment variables (database name, username, passwords, admin credentials).

3. Run both services together using a single command:

- docker compose up -d


4. Access the Keycloak Admin Console at http://localhost:8080 to manage users, roles, and authentication.
